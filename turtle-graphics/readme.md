# Turtle Graphics

Turtle is a Python package that allows you to display <br>
graphics and interact with the user because it can listen for <br>
keyboard presses.

## Demos
### [ten-shapes](01_ten_shapes/main.py)
As the shapes are drawn each with an increasing number of sides, watch
how the lins change colours randomly, the lines thicken and the drawing
speeds up

### [Analogue Digital Clock](02_digital_analogue_clock/main.py)
A clock runs for a minute-showing the seconds ticking past
and on the minute the hour and minute hands are redrawn.

### [Etch A Sketch](03_etch_a_sketch/main.py )
Classic Etch A Sketch toy <br>
Uses a listener to wait for usr input to move the cursor around,
and to increase or decrease the length of the line each keypress
causes

`to_do: put in a key press to shake the toy and fill the screen with white!`

`to_do: Choose from a number of preset shapes drawn by the computer in a light colour, and time
    how long it takes the user to draw the same shape.`

`to_do: Score the user's shape drawing on accuracy as well as time (this will take some doing!)`
