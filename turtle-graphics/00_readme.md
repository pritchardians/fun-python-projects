# Turtle Graphics

Turtle is a Python package that allows you to display <br>
graphics and interact with the user because it can listen for <br>
keyboard presses.

## Demos
### [ten-shapes](01_ten_shapes.py)
As the shapes are drawn each with an increasing number of sides, watch
how the lins change colours randomly, the lines thicken and the drawing
speeds up

### [Etch A Sketch](02_etch-a-sketch.py)
Classic Etch A Sketch toy <br>
Uses a listener to wait for usr input to move the cursor around,
and to increase or decrease the length of the line each keypress
causes

to_do: put in a key press to shake the toy and fill the screen with white!
